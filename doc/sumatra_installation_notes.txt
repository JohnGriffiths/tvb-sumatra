Sumatra Installation Notes
==========================

I have found Sumatra a real pain to install. 

But seem to be reaching some general solutions. 

Here's some notes:


Installation / Sumatra / Gitpython
----------------------------------

- The main problems I've had have been to do with sumatra and gitpython

  If having problems, uninstall both sumatra and gitpython
  MAKE SURE you have completely uninstalled them; 
  ...i.e. 
  - run 'pip uninstall sumatra' until pip knows nothing, 
  - open python and try importing sumatra. Shouldn't work. 
  - Check there's no folders called sumatra in the python library 
    ( in my case /home/brain/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages ), 
    ...or anywhere else on PYTHONPATH
  - which there are no smt binaries 'smt' and 'smtweb' on PYTHONPATH
  - An option is to use the development version of sumatra from bitbucket. 
    This might solve some more advanced or specific installation and/or usage problems, but shouldn't  be essential for basic functionality. 

- Same for gitpython. 
  - You might have several versions of this installed
  - To test the python installation, start python and type 'import git'
  - **Important**: need gitpython version > 0.2
    To install: pip install GitPython==0.3.0-beta1 -I
    (the '-I' tells it to ignore other installed versions. This shouldn't 
    be an issue if all the above is done properly though). 
  - **Important**: make sure pygit (alternative library for python-git binding)
    is NOT installed. GitPython and pygit can be confused because in both cases you use 'import git'.
  - Best to install gitpython before sumatra. And/or re-install sumatra after installing gitpython. 



Once installed, make sure the sumatra library is on the PYTHONPATH, and the location of the smt and smtweb binaries is on PATH. 










Yoavram smt_test github repo
----------------------------

There's a very useful github repo for testing sumatra installation. 
Pretty self explanatory

Virtualenv

This in general advisable if possible.
